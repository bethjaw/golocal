#GOLOCAL

GOLOCAL is a mobile app for travel recommendations from people you know and trust.  

Unlike other sites, on GOLOCAL you have your own network of individuals and have access to all of their locations, recommendations, and tips so when traveling to a new city or country, you can know where to go, what to do, how to get there, what to pack, etc from someone you know who has been there and done it.
